            story: "This is my fit journey with Shredz! Like many I found it very hard to lose weight after having my 3 children and was unmotivated to do so. I knew I needed help and found it with Shredz!  Shredz gave me the energy I needed to get through my whole day and motivated me through their simple workout guide to know that it's possible to workout at home or the gym and reach the goals I made. Shredz supplements helped me to recover quicker from my workouts so I could continue pushing through harder. Not to mention all the support and encouragement they gave me to do my best from their support team. If I had a question they answered it right away if I had a problem they solved it right away all with a positive message and attitude! I was also very motivated by the fact that Shredz gives back to its customers, that showed me that they were confident in their product so in turn that made me confident about it too! Thanks Shredz"

            story: "Fitness and health have become my lifestyle and passion. This journey of mine, which is just the beginning, has been the most rewarding feeling of accomplishment to date for me. Down 16 inches in the waist, 3 shirt sizes while increasing lean muscle and losing over 28% body fat. But the most rewarding feeling has been adding years to my life. My reward for believing in myself, for pushing myself in the gym harder than I thought I could and for being dedicated and consistent to clean healthy eating habits. I loved seeing stories from others on Instagram and what Shredz was doing for them. I related so much to that. It has motivated and inspired me to keep pushing and griding to be a better me. With Shredz I noticed I had more focus and drive during my workout sessions with clean sustained energy and the recovery from my training has been unmatched. I have tried many supplements and Shredz is no doubt the top of the line. Combining the workouts and meal plans have helped me reach goals I once thought were unobtainable for someone like me. Now I have only set new and bigger goals."

In the beginning I thought it was just about looking skinny and like all the women in the magazines, but Shredz taught me it is about being healthy and loving yourself. Shredz helped me lose about 30 pounds and drop my body fat percentage.  By hard work in the gym and taking Shredz supplements I have not only been able to keep the weight off, but I have continued to lose weight while building muscle. Without the support of family, friends, and Shredz I would not have been able to do this. I have never been happier!"

            story: "My journey started after having 2 kids and gaining an excessive amount of weight during the pregnancies. I decided it was time to get my old body back, but wasn't having any success. Before I started taking Shredz supplements, I was always tired, hungry all the time, struggled through my workouts, and depressed when I looked in the mirror.  Once I started taking their high quality supplements last year, I immediately noticed I had energy again, my appetite was suppressed, and I killed my workouts! Using a collaboration of their informative/easy to follow workouts, watching the inspirational videos, taking Shredz supplements, and using their well balanced eating guides & recipes is what kept me inspired, motivated, and driven the whole time! Shredz is with you all the way, they pushed me through what I didn't think I was able to achieve; for that I am forever grateful to Shredz and their amazing support team. \"Courage means never giving up\".  It means believing that \"you\" can make a difference, and that is what I did! Do it right the first time, you'll never know the strength you had!   Shredz has literally changed my life for the better, physically and mentally!"

            story: "At the end of 2014, I began a lot of reflection on my life and asking myself many questions. What can I do next year that will make my life better? What goal can I set for myself that will give me a sense of achievement & accomplishment?? With a 30th birthday quickly approaching, I felt this drive and desperate need to reclaim my self-worth. I told myself This year is your year. You will be healthy, you will be fit, and you will be HAPPY. It was so powerful and left me setting some very serious resolutions for myself at the mark of the new year. I began exploring healthy eating habits and also began researching supplements to assist with fitness goals. This ultimately led to my discovery of SHREDZ. I was tired of feeling ashamed of my body and wanted to begin 2015 with all of the knowledge and tools to prepare for my new goals. I knew I had to be organized. I knew I had to be different. I knew I had to change my whole way of thinking and living. Come January 1, 2015 I was ready!!! I focused all of my energy on becoming this better me. I began taking my SHREDZ Alpha Female Stack, eating healthy and made working out a daily routine. No more excuses, I just DID. The results didn’t happen overnight but I knew if I just stuck with it, if I just kept pushing, it would all be worth it soon. It took time and patience but the body fat I hated slowly started to disappear. Each week I felt myself getting stronger, tighter, faster! It was an amazing feeling to see my transformation begin. The more results I saw, the more determined I was. Most importantly, the love I lost for myself started to rekindle. I began to feel confident and beautiful... feelings I wasn’t sure I’d ever feel again. For me SHREDZ is not JUST a product, it’s a movement that has changed my life and one that I am very passionate about. I speak so highly and spread the word about SHREDZ products because I truly believe in them.  I hope that my transformation will inspire and encourage others to take a chance and let SHREDZ give them a jumpstart with their healthy lifestyles."

            story: "My name is John Bellmore. I first discovered Shredz through social media, I believe it was Instagram, where I followed several of their athletes. What attracted me to Shredz was that the people using the products seemed genuine. They weren't people who used steroids or were handed great deals in life, they were hard workers who through health and fitness were living their dreams and trying to help others to do the same. That's what I wanted to do with my life. Unfortunately I was nowhere near being able to do that at the time. I had recently gone through a serious relationship breakup that had left me feeling broken and depressed. Years before I had overcome a problem with alcohol, and fitness played an important part in that. Due to support from loved ones I did not not resume drinking, however for months afterwards all I did was lay around on the couch watching TV, drinking sodas, and eating chips, candy, snack cakes, and fast food. I was 195 when the breakup happened, and within three months had gotten up to 213 lbs at 5'10\" tall. I believe at one point I was all the way up to 217. I was miserable. Walking up the stairs and bending over to tie my shoes would leave me out of breath. This was not me or how I wanted to be. Years ago I had even been a personal trainer! I decided I needed to change or I was going to die. I saw a flash sale for Shredz and placed my order. It came with instructions on how to enter a 30 day challenge. I've always been competitive so I thought why not? But this time I was competing with myself for myself. I took the bloated, fat, out of shape before pictures then I started hitting the gym. I knew everything I needed to know about lifting weights and enjoyed doing it. Cardio took a little more time to begin and get used to, but I got there. Eating and sleeping right were the big obstacles. Shredz told me exactly when I should take what supplements, so I used that as a rough guideline on when to eat. Eventually it all fell into place and I found myself embracing a healthy, fit lifestyle. I took my after pictures each 30 days and submitted them. I never really thought much about that afterwards because I had accomplished my personal goals and was happy with that. People noticed the physical change and asked me how I did it. I always told them what I've said here about Shredz. I'd forgotten about the contest when I got the notification that I was one of four finalists. Voting was done through their Instagram followers and I won! This encouraged me to go after a personal trainer certification again as I was already working with a few close friends to help them achieve their fitness goals. That's what I want to do: help others be healthy and fit. If I can do it at 49 years old, I know they can, too, especially with the aid of great products from Shredz and the inspiration to be gotten on their social media pages, as well as those of their athletes Paige, Eva Marie, Jessica, Devin, Joey, and Jonathan to name a few."

            story: "My fitness story begun just shy of one year ago. I have struggled with my weight my whole life and after being discharged from the Air Force it only got worse. During my time as an active duty Airman I had two shoulder surgeries a year apart from each other on the same shoulder. I was told by one doctor that I'd never be \"physically active again\". Once I got discharged from the Air Force I gained 30+ pounds and was very depressed. One day I looked in the mirror and I knew I needed to make a change. I completely changed my diet and then started exercising but I could never get through a workout without feeling like death. Not to mention my weight seemed to continue to grow. I tired many different products and nothing helped. Then one day I stumbled upon Shredz on Instagram. I looked into it and did my research and finally I just took a leap of faith. That leap of faith was just under 7 months ago and I am never looking back. With Shredz I was able to lose 30 pound in 6 months and it has helped me in every aspect of my life. I am able to push through my workouts with more ease and I find myself with more energy to make my workouts longer and harder. Shredz has given me the courage to try new types of workouts without worrying about my shoulder failing on me. I have taken up running, I run five or so miles a day four days a week, I have taken up yoga, and I am now getting into weight lifting with the help of friends. I am a Shredz user for life and am so thankful for this product!"
