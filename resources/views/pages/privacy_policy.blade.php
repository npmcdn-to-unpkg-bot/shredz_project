                <p>
                    This privacy statement covers the site at <a href="{{ url('/') }}">{{ $domain }}</a>. Because SHREDZ Supplements LLC
                    (hereafter “Shredz”) wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy, it is disclosing its
                    information practices policy and invites public comment on this policy. The statement explains the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>What personally identifiable information SHREDZ collects.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How SHREDZ uses the information.</p></li>

                    <li><p>How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our
                    newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. When ordering or registering on our site, as deemed
                    appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or
                    credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.
                </p>
                <h2>What do we use your information for?</h2>
                <h3>Log Files</h3>
                <p>
                    Like most standard web sites, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
                    type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number
                    of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather
                    broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use a tracking utility that collates data from log
                    files to analyze user movement.
                </p>
                <h3>Communicate Special Offers and Updates</h3>
                <p>
                    We send all new members a welcoming email to verify the desire to receive email from us. Established
                    members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.
                    Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of
                    communications. Please see the Choice/Opt Out section.
                </p>
                <h3>Email Newsletter</h3>
                <p>
                    If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email
                    address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way for the user to opt out of these
                    communications. Please see the Choice/Opt Out section.
                </p>
                <h3>Provide Service Announcements</h3>
                <p>
                    On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance,
                    if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally,
                    users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However,
                    these communications are not promotional in nature.
                </p>
                <h3>Customer Service</h3>
                <p>
                    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and with regard to issues
                    relating to their account, we may reply via email or phone.
                </p>
                <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
                <p>
                    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you
                    place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the
                    confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all
                    financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information
                    online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access
                    to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information
                    to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on
                    third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware.
                    We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site,
                    you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage
                    and a hardware firewall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee
                    complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.)
                    will not be stored on our servers.
                </p>
                <h2>SHARING</h2>
                <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>
                    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when
                    required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current
                    judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site. Where possible, we will
                    notify affected users before disclosing information in response to a subpoena.
                </p>
                <h3>Business Transitions</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event Shredz goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another
                    company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances,
                    be part of the assets transferred.
                </p>
                <h3>Links</h3>
                <p>
                    This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, SHREDZ, are not responsible for
                    the privacy practices of any other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site
                    and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
                    information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
                </p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>
                    This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive
                    information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
                    security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in
                    the industry — SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web
                    browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
                    un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our
                    power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive
                    information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information
                    to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the
                    servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked
                    facility.
                </p>
                <h3>Choice/Opt Out</h3>
                <p>
                    Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional communications may opt out of
                    receiving these communications by sending email to unsubscribe@shredz.com. We also offer an opt out
                    mechanism at https://www.shredz.com or the user may opt out by contacting us at the address below.
