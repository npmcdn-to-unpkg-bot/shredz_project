								<h3>STEP 1</h3>
								<h4>Choose your plan</h4>
								<p>We offer 4, 8, and 12 week plans that contain both a personalized diet and training program. We recommend that you commit to a full 12 weeks to see a big transformation in your weight, body composition, and athletic performance. </p>
								<p>The 4 and 8 week options are recommended for those who are already very close to their goal, or as an add-on to a 12 week plan for continued progress. </p>
